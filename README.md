Quizzical is a trivia game made with React. Trivia are questions pulled from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). Choose from 3 difficulties and 25 categories!

This is the final solo project of the [Intro to React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) on Scrimba.com. Additional functionality was added such as the ability to choose difficulty and category. Almost all code and CSS was written by myself. A big thanks to Bob Ziroll on Scrimba for the idea, title, and some design direction!
